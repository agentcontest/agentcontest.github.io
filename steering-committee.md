Steering Committee Charter
--------------------------

### Long term aim

The Multi-Agent Programming Contest (AgentContest) strives to stimulate
research in the area of multi-agent system development and programming by

1. identifying key problems in the field and
2. collecting suitable benchmarks that can serve as milestones for testing
   multi-agent programming languages, platforms and tools.

Through a constant AgentContest evolution based on the past organization
experience, the AgentContest organizing bodies aim to contribute to the
exploration and thus advance the understanding of this research field.

### Steering Committee

The Steering Committee's main task is to collect and maintain the know how
of the AgentContest organization. It overlooks the AgentContest edition
organization and advises the organizing committee in order to
ensure persistent striving for the long-term aims.

#### Tasks and competences

In particular, the steering committee:

1. regularly appoints an Organizing Committee for the upcoming edition
   of the AgentContest;
2. advises the Organizing Committee in issues of AgentContest scenario design
   and provides guidance regarding the administrative and organisational issues
   of the AgentContest organization;
3. overlooks the organisation and if needed, it has a right to step into it
   in order to resolve critical issues of technical, planning and social nature
   which might arise. This will be done in a sensitive manner and only
   in a minimal required extent;
4. helps the Oroganizing Committee to liase with finding a workshop
   or conference with which the AgentContest can be asociated;
5. collects and maintains the know-how about operational issues regarding
   organization of AgentContest. If needed, the Steering Committee can ask
   the Organizing Committee to prepare and submit an informal report
   summarizing the experience with organization of the corresponding
   AgentContest edition;
6. owns, manages and maintains the Internet domain name for the AgentContest
   WWW presentation.

#### Membership

The Steering Committee consists of senior community members who participated
in the AgentContest organization in the past. Any changes of the membership
underlie a 2/3 majority vote of the current Steering Committee members.

#### Voting and decision making

As a rule, the Steering Committee should strive for unanimous decision making.
If this is not possible, except for the membership issues (as regulated above),
the general rule is the simple majority vote.

### Organization Committee

The Organization Committee takes care for the operational aspects of
the AgentContest organization. It is appointed by the Steering Committee for
the purpose of organizing the single upcoming edition of the AgentContest,
possibly associated with another workshop or conference.

#### Tasks and competences

In particular, the Organizing Committee:

1. formulates and implements the detailed AgentContest edition scenario in a
   manner respecting the overall aims of the AgentContest;
2. formulates the organization schedule and takes care of the overall
   submission and publication process, as well as all the announcements
   relevant to the AgentContest edition;
3. optionally, in cooperation with the Steering Committee it issues
   and delivers a prize to the AgentContest edition winners;
4. after the end of the AgentContest edition prepares and publishes a public
   report of the Contest which should be reviewed and archived
   by the Steering Committee;
5. if requested by the Steering Committee, the Organization Committee prepares
   a written report regarding the experience with organizing
   the actual AgentContest edition;
6. technically secures the WWW presentation of the Contest edition
   on the AgentContest WWW home page.

#### Appointing the Organization Committee

The Steering Committee appoints the Organization Committee in a timely fashion,
in order to enable proper AgentContest edition organization. As of a rule,
the Organization Committee should consists of at least one member of the
Steering Committee and one or more chosen members of the research community.
The joint member of the Organization and the Steering Committee should act as
the senior/team leader of the organizing team.
