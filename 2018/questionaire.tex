\section{Team overview: short answers}

\subsection{Participants and their background}

\begin{description}
  \item \textbf{What was your motivation to participate in the contest?}
    Your answer ...
  \item \textbf{What is the history of your group? (course project, thesis, \ldots)}
  \item \textbf{What is your field of research? Which work therein is related?}
\end{description}

\subsection{Development}

\begin{description}
  \item \textbf{How much time did you invest in the contest for}
    \begin{description}
      \item \textbf{programming vs. other tasks (for example organization)?}
      \item \textbf{creating vs. optimizing your agents?}
    \end{description}
  \item \textbf{How many lines of code did you produce for your final agent team?}
  \item \textbf{How many people were involved and to which degree?}
  \item \textbf{When did you start working on your agents?}
\end{description}

\subsection{System details}

\begin{description}
  \item \textbf{How do your agents work together? (coordination, information sharing, \ldots)}
  \item \textbf{What are critical components of your team?}
  \item \textbf{Can your agents change their behavior during runtime? If so, what triggers the changes?}
  \item \textbf{Did you have to make changes to the team (e.g. fix critical bugs) during the contest?}
  \item \textbf{How do you organize your agents? Do you use e.g. hierarchies? Is your organization implicit or explicit?}
  \item \textbf{Is most of your agents' behavior emergent on an individual or team level?}
  \item \textbf{If your agents perform some planning, how many steps do they plan ahead?}
  \item \textbf{If you have a perceive-think-act cycle, how is it synchronized with the server?}
  \item \textbf{How did you go about debugging your system?}
  \item \textbf{Which operating system did you use, and is your team portable to other operating systems?}
  \item \textbf{What hardware did you use to run your agent team? (RAM, CPU, disk space, multiple computers, any other notable requirements)}
\end{description}

\subsection{Scenario and Strategy}

\begin{description}
  \item \textbf{What is the main strategy of your agent team?}
  \item \textbf{How do your agents decide which jobs to complete?}
  \item \textbf{Do you have different strategies for the different roles?}
  \item \textbf{Do your agents form ad-hoc teams to complete a task?}
  \item \textbf{How do your agents decide when and where to build wells?}
  \item \textbf{If your agents accumulated a lot of currency, why did they not spend it immediately?}
\end{description}

\subsection{And the moral of it is ...}

\begin{description}
  \item \textbf{What did you learn from participating in the contest?}
  \item \textbf{What are the strong and weak points of your team?}
  \item \textbf{How viable were your chosen programming language, methodology, tools, and algorithms?}
  \item \textbf{Did you encounter new problems during the contest?}
  \item \textbf{Did playing against other agent teams bring about new insights on your own agents?}
  \item \textbf{What would you improve if you wanted to participate in the same contest a week from now (or next year)?}
  \item \textbf{Which aspect of your team cost you the most time?}
  \item \textbf{Why did your team perform as it did? Why did the other teams perform better/worse than you did?}
\end{description}

\subsection{The future of the MAPC}

\begin{description}
  \item \textbf{What can be improved regarding the contest for next year?}
  \item \textbf{What kind of scenario would you like to play next? What kind of features should the new scenario have?}
  \item \textbf{Should the teams be allowed to make changes to their agents during the contest (even based on opponent agent behavior observed in earlier matches)? If yes, should only some changes be legal and which ones (e.g. bugfixes), and how to decide a changeâ€™s classification? If no, should we ensure that no changes are made and how?}
  \item \textbf{Do you have ideas to reduce the impact of unforeseen strategies (e.g., playing a second leg after some time)?}
\end{description}
