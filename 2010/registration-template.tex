\begin{abstract}
Please follow the given template structure for your submission by
answering the questions as concisely as possible, not exceeding the
total of \textbf{5} pages. It is vital to explain in this submission
a \textit{description} of the 
system, the methodology/tools/infrastructure used
and the (team) strategy
that
you plan to use in the contest.

Please send your submission by email to J\"urgen Dix 
(\url{dix@tu-clausthal.de}) no later
than August 9th. If modifications are necessary,
we will directly ask you to submit a final version on August 16th.

\section{Introduction}

Note: the information you provide in this section will be made available
to all participants. We will put it on the homepage.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the name of your team?
\item Who are the members of your team? Please provide names,
academic degrees and institutions.
\item Which platform/architecture do you use?
\item Who is the main-contact?
\item How much time (man hours) will you have invested (approximately) until the tournament?
\end{enumerate}

\section{System Analysis and Design}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item How is your system  specified and designed?
  \item Did you use any existing multi-agent system
  methodology such as Prometheus, Gaia or Tropos?
  \item Which strategies and algorithms do you plan to use?
  \item How are the following agent features implemented:
  \emph{autonomy}, \emph{proactiveness}
  and \emph{communication}m \emph{team working}, and \emph{coordination}?
  \item Is your system a truly \textbf{multi}-agent system or
  rather a centralised system in disguise?
\end{enumerate}



\section{Software Architecture}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Which programming language do you plan to use to implement the multi-agent system?
  \item How would you map the designed architecture (both multi-agent and individual agent architectures)
    to programming codes, i.e., how would you implement specific agent-oriented
    concepts and designed artifacts using the programming language?
  \item Which development platform, tools and techniques are you planning to use?

\end{enumerate}
Please give reasons why you have chosen the methods explained above.

\section{Agent team strategy}

Please address the following points, or at least comment if not applicable:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe the navigation algorithms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item obstacle avoiding
            \item strategy for finding and herding cows
            \item opponent blocking
        \end{itemize}
    \item Describe the team coordination strategy (if any)
    \item Does your team strategy use some distributed optimization
        technique w.r.t. e.g.  minimizing distances walked by the
        agents?
    \item Describe and discuss the information exchanged (and shared) in
        the agent team.
    \item Describe the communication strategy in the agent team. Can you
        estimate the communication complexity in your approach?
    \item Did your system do some background processing? Under background
        processing we understand some computation which happened while agents of
        the team were \textit{idle}, i.e. between sending an action
        message to the simulation server and receiving a perception
        message for the subsequent simulation step.
    \item Possibly discuss additional technical details of your system like
        e.g. failure/crash recovery and alike.
\end{enumerate}
