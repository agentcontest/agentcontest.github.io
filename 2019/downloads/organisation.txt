MAPC Organisation & Guidelines

Contest

- Each team plays one match of 3 simulations against each other team.
- Winning a simulation awards 3 points. A draw results in 1 point for each team.
- The team with the most points wins the tournament.
    - If 2 or more teams are tied for a place, they will share the same placement.
- The “web monitor” will not be available during the matches (only a version with very basic information).
- The agents may be modified during the tournament. Changes should be documented and submitted to the organisers after the contest to support the contest analysis.
- If there is any hardware or software failure on the part of the contest organisation, we may decide to reschedule and replay the affected match (depending on severity).

Technical

- The server may provide additional information (beyond what agents receive in their messages) to (human) spectators. Agents may not get access to this information.
- Agents may reconnect at any time to their current simulation.
- Any programming language, framework, etc. may be used to create agents.

Scenario

- A simulation is won by the team with the most points.
- If both teams are tied, the simulation ends in a draw.
