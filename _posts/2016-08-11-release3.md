Today we are releasing another [software package](/2016/massim-2016-1.3-bin.tar.gz) together with a simple [statistics tool](/2016/statistics-1.0.zip).

CHANGELOG
---------

* added a new statistics generator (separate JAR)
* item percepts are now added in alphabetical order
* fixed a bug where "item"-tags/percepts where not added to the storage tag/percept
* fix "call_breakdown_service" action from being shown as "not supported by entity" (hopefully)
* made the AgentsInterpreter execute the agents in deterministic order
* updated the test agents (so they should work a little bit more reliably now)
