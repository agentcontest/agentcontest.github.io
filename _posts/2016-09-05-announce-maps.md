The maps for the contest are finally unveiled! We will play the well-known London and Hannover maps that were already part of the package. Unfortunately, since Clausthal is a very small town, we will play the third simulation each on the map of San Francisco instead. Also, we released a new server package (1.3.1) including all 3 maps and a sim config for them (also we fixed some exceptions that could happen with the new map). Get the maps from the [2016 contest page](/2016/getting-started).
