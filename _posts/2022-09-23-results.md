We support the [PhD project](https://tas-security.lancs.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Juliana-Michelon.pdf) of Juliana Michelon. It is on Distributed Cognition in
Human-Machine Systems and for us, it consists of a series of interviews to get the perspective of contest participants and organisers alike. For more information, check the [project overview](https://tas-security.lancs.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Juliana-Michelon.pdf) and the [post on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/agentcontest/c/auXpdQlEXrg).
