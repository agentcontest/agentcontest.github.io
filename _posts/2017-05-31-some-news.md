Here's a tiny update about what has been going on in the last couple of weeks. First, we have released a number of (mostly) bugfix updates over at [GitHub](https://github.com/agentcontest/massim/releases) and will continue doing so.

Second, we have fixed some preliminary dates for the contest! Have a look at the official [Call for Participation](/2017/CFP.txt) or the 2017 [contest page](/2017).
