======== CALL FOR PARTICIPATION ========

    16th MAPC (2022)
    Multi-Agent Programming Contest
    https://multiagentcontest.org/2022/

========================================


We are happy to announce the Multi-Agent Programming Contest will once again take place in 2022.
The competition is - as usual - designed for completely remote participation.


1. AIMS AND SCOPE

This competition is an attempt to stimulate research in the area
of multi-agent system development and programming by
1. identifying key problems,
2. collecting suitable benchmarks, and
3. gathering test cases
that can serve as milestones for testing multi-agent programming
languages, platforms, and tools. We also expect that participating
in the contest will help to debug existing systems and frameworks and 
to identify their weak and strong aspects.

The performance of a particular system will be determined in a
series of games where the systems compete against each other.
While winning the competition is not the main point, we hope it will
shed light on the applicability of certain frameworks to particular
domains.


2. HISTORY

The Multi-Agent Programming Contest was initiated in 2005 and is now in its 6th phase.

2005: the "food-gatherers"-scenario, where a pre-specified multi-agent
system had to be implemented. These MASs were later examined in order
to determine the winner.
2006 - 2007: the "goldminers"-scenario, where  we provided the environment by means of an online-architecture and automatically determined the winner.
2008 - 2010: the "cows and cowboys"-scenario, again on the online-architecture, but with a slightly changed objective.
2011 - 2014: the "agents on Mars"-scenario, where agents had to solve a different more complex problem.
2016-2018: the "agents in the city"-scenario, played on realistic street graphs, where agents had to solve logistics puzzles.

2019-NOW: The "Agents Assemble"-scenario combines many aspects which have proven interesting in previous scenarios. The agents have to move in a dynamic grid-world with limited local information and cooperate to find and combine pieces in order to complete randomized tasks. For 2022, norms have been introduced as a new challenge.


3. ENROLLING AND DOWNLOAD

4. Submitting the source-code of your application right after the tournament.
5. Submission of a team description and analysis paper after the tournament.


5. ROUGH TIMELINE

5 August 2022: registration deadline.

26 August 2022: qualification deadline.

Week of 19 September 2022: tournament.

After tournament: publications.


6. PUBLICATIONS

After the tournament we invite each participant to submit a paper
about their agent team. The papers of which the quality has been assured
will be regularly published in Springer's new Computer Challenges subline:
