\maketitle

\section{Team overview: short answers}

\subsection{Participants and their background}
\begin{description}
    \item \q{Who is part of your team?}
    \\ Your answer ...
    \item \q{What was your motivation to participate in the contest?}
    \item \q{What is the history of your group? (course project, thesis, $\ldots$)}
    \item \q{What is your field of research? Which work therein is related?}
\end{description}

\subsection{Statistics}
\begin{description}
    \item \q{Did you start your agent team from scratch, or did you build on existing agents (from yourself or another previous participant)?}
    \item \q{How much time did you invest in the contest (for programming, organising your group, other)?}
    \item \q{How was the time (roughly) distributed over the months before the contest?}
    \item \q{How many lines of code did you produce for your final agent team?}
    % \item \q{How many people were involved?}
    % \item \q{When did you start working on your agents?}
\end{description}

\subsection{Technology \& Techniques}
\textbf{Did you use any of these agent technology/AOSE methods or tools? What were your experiences?}
\begin{description}
    \item \q{Agent programming languages and/or frameworks?}
    \item \q{Methodologies (e.g. Prometheus)?}
    \item \q{Notation (e.g. Agent UML)?}
    \item \q{Coordination mechanisms (e.g. protocols, games, \dots)?}
    \item \q{Other (methods/concepts/tools)?}
\end{description}
\textbf{What hardware did you use during the contest?}

\subsection{Agent system details}
\begin{description}
    % \item \q{How does the team work together? (i.e. coordination, information sharing, ...) How decentralised is your approach?}
    \item \q{Would you say your system is decentralised? Why?}
    \item \q{Do your agents use the following features: Planning, Learning, Organisations, Norms? If so, please elaborate briefly.}
    \item \q{How do your agents cooperate?}
    \item \q{Can your agents change their general behaviour during run time? If so, what triggers the changes?}
    \item \q{Did you have to make changes to the team (e.g. fix critical bugs) during the contest?}
    \item \q{How did you go about debugging your system? What kinds of measures could improve your debugging experience?}
    \item \q{During the contest, you were not allowed to watch the matches. How did you track what was going on? Was it helpful?}
    \item \q{Did you invest time in making your agents more robust/fault-tolerant? How?}
\end{description}

\subsection{Scenario and Strategy}
\begin{description}
    %\item \q{What is the main strategy of your agent team?}
    \item \q{How would you describe your intended agent behaviour? Did the actual behaviour deviate from that?}
    % \item \q{Please explain whether you think you came up with a good strategy or you rather enabled your agents to find the best strategy.}
    % \item \q{What are the strong and weak points of your team?}
    \item \q{Why did your team perform as it did? Why did the other teams perform better/worse than you did?}
    \item \q{Did you implement any strategy that tries to interfere with your opponents?}
    % \item \q{How do your agents decide which tasks to complete?}
    \item \q{How do your agents coordinate assembling and delivering a structure for a task?}
    \item \q{Which aspect(s) of the scenario did you find particularly challenging?}
    \item \q{What would you improve (wrt. your agents) if you wanted to participate in the same contest a week from now (or next year)?}
    \item \q{What can be improved regarding the scenario for next year? What would you remove? What would you add?}
\end{description}

\subsection{And the moral of it is \ldots}
\begin{description}
    \item \q{What did you learn from participating in the contest?}
    \item \q{What advice would you give to yourself before the contest/another team wanting to participate in the next?}
    \item \q{Where did you benefit from your chosen programming language, methodology, tools, and algorithms?}
    \item \q{Which problems did you encounter because of your chosen technologies?}
    % \item \q{Did you encounter previously unseen problems/bugs during the contest?}
    % \item \q{Did playing against other agent teams bring about new insights on your own agents?}
    \item \q{Which aspect of your team cost you the most time?}
\end{description}

\subsection{Looking into the Future}
\begin{description}
    \item \q{Did the warm-up match help improve your team of agents? How useful do you think it is?}
    \item \q{What are your thoughts on changing how the contest is run, so that the participants' agents are executed on the same infrastructure by the organisers? What do you see as positive or negative about this approach?}
    \item \q{Do you think a match containing more than two teams should be mandatory?}
    % \item \q{Should the MAPC evaluate the participant's system using criteria other than the final score?}
    \item \q{What else can be improved regarding the MAPC for next year?}
\end{description}
