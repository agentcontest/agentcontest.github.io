\begin{abstract}
Please follow the given template structure for your submission by
answering the questions as concisely as possible, not exceeding the
total of \textbf{5} pages. It is vital to explain in this submission
1) \textit{a description of the team strategy (or strategies)} that
you plan to use in the contest, 2) \textit{a discussion on the
experience} gathered in the course of developing the agent team so
far, and 3) some \textit{feedback} about the contest organization,
the proposed scenario, and the setup would be a valuable information
for organizing this and future editions of the contest. An important
topic is to explain whether your system is already a truly
multi-agent system or rather a (single) agent system, that you are
planning to extend into a multi agent system in the future. The
submissions should be send by email to J\"urgen Dix 
(\url{dix@tu-clausthal.de}) no later
than March 7th (extended deadline). If modifications are necessary,
we will directly ask you to submit a final version on March 12th.

\section{Introduction}

\section{System Analysis and Design}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item How is your system  specified and designed?
  \item Did you use any existing multi-agent system
  methodology such as Prometheus, Gaia or Tropos?
  \item Which strategies and algorithms do you plan to use?
  \item How are the following agent features implemented:
  \emph{autonomy}, \emph{proactiveness}
  and \emph{communication}m \emph{team working}, and \emph{coordination}?
  \item Is your system a truly \textbf{multi}-agent system or
  rather a centralised system in disguise?
\end{enumerate}



\section{Software Architecture}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Which programming language do you plan to use to implement the multi-agent system?
  \item How would you map the designed architecture (both multi-agent and individual agent architectures)
    to programming codes, i.e., how would you implement specific agent-oriented
    concepts and designed artifacts using the programming language?
  \item Which development platform, tools and techniques are you planning to use?

\end{enumerate}
Please give reasons why you have chosen the methods explained above.

\section{Agent team strategy}

Please address the following points, or at least comment if not applicable:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe the navigation algorithms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item obstacle avoiding
            \item strategy for finding and herding cows
            \item opponent blocking
        \end{itemize}
    \item Describe the team coordination strategy (if any)
    \item Does your team strategy use some distributed optimization
        technique w.r.t. e.g.  minimizing distances walked by the
        agents?
    \item Describe and discuss the information exchanged (and shared) in
        the agent team.
    \item Describe the communication strategy in the agent team. Can you
        estimate the communication complexity in your approach?
    \item Did you system do some background processing? Under background
        processing we understand some computation which happened while agents of
        the team were \textit{idle}, i.e. between sending an action
        message to the simulation server and receiving a perception
        message for the subsequent simulation step.
    \item Possibly discuss additional technical details of your system like
        e.g. failure/crash recovery and alike.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion}
In this section please expand a bit on your experience with the
contest organization, the proposed scenario, and the setup of the
actual contest. Please indicate what do you see as pros/cons of
participating in the Contest with respect to your research in the
field.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Critical discussion of your approach to the development of the
        agent team.
    \item Would you gain some insights/experiences into developing multi-agent system in
        the course of participating in the Agent Contest so far? If so,
        what kind of?
    \item Do you think that the Agent Contest can served its
        purpose to provide a testbed for state-of-the-art multi-agent
        systems development frameworks?
    \item Describe and discuss possible problems that you face in choosing approach, programming
        platform or technical infrastructure to participate in this contest?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Additional feedback}
Additionally, we would like to ask you to provide us with a feedback to the
organization of the Agent Contest 2007. Several suggestions were already
collected during the Contest via personal communication on the AC'07 mailing
list. However, now with a time distance, do you have any additional comments,
suggestions or complaints?
