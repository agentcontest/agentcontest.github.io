This competition is an attempt to **stimulate research in the area of
multi-agent system development and programming** by

1. **identifying key problems**,
2. **collecting suitable benchmarks**, and
3. **gathering test cases** which require and enforce coordinated action

that can serve as milestones for testing multi-agent programming languages,
platforms and tools. We also expect that participating at the contest helps
to debug existing systems and to identify their weak and strong aspects.

The performance of a particular system will be determined in a series of
games where the systems compete against each other. While winning the
competition is not the main point, we hope it will shed light on the
applicability of certain frameworks to particular domains.
